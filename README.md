Overwatch League Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## Project Overview
As a long-term Overwatch player with a strong passion for gaming, I chose this project for my ISBA 4715 class, but I viewed it more as a passion project than a school assignment. In this project, I extracted data from both Battle.Net's API and Twitch's API, focusing on various aspects such as Overwatch League (OWL) team win rates and Twitch video or stream viewership, among others. After obtaining the data, I uploaded the dataframes to my AWS database and configured them using MySQL. With the 8 tables I created, some containing over 300+ rows, I aimed to analyze the data to determine the ways Blizzard could improve Overwatch's gameplay, ultimately leading to increased player engagement and satisfaction.
